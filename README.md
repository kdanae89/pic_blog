# pic_blog

This is a website built for users to input and share photos. The user has the ability to register with a unique username and password, log in, ensuring only they can edit and delete their content and navigate the site to view other users' content.

The site was built using node.js, mongoDB and mongoose. I intended to have used an API for the image uploading and sharing but didn't get to it. For now the images need to be hosted by another site (I use imgur, its free and easy) and then you input the image url into the input.

As far as I know there are no bugs interfering with use, but there are a few things I would like to implement before use and that's password hashing for security and more user interactivity such as a comment section and like buttons.
