# Photo Drop

This is a website built for users to post and share photos. The user has the ability to register with a unique username and password, log in, ensuring only they can edit and delete their own content and navigate the site to view other users' content.

### no installation required!

The site was built using node.js, mongoDB and mongoose. I intended to have used an API for the image uploading and sharing but didn't get to it. For now the images need to be hosted by another site (I use imgur, its free and easy) and then you post the image url into the input.

There is one bug, if the user enters the wrong password, it breaks the app on heroku. Due to time constraints for this project, I'm moving forward but there are a few things I would have liked to do given more time, which is password hashing for security and more user interactivity such as a comment section and like buttons.
